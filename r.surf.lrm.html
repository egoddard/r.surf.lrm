<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>


<p><em><strong>r.surf.lrm</strong></em> generates a local relief model from lidar-derived high-resolution DEMs. Local relief models enhance the visibility of small-scale surface features by removing large-scale landforms from the DEM.</p>

<p>Generating the LRM is accomplished in 7 steps (Hesse 2010:69):</p>
<ol>
    <li>Creation of the DEM from the LIDAR data. Buildings, trees and other objects on the earth's surface should be removed.</li>
    <li>Apply a low pass filter to the DEM. The low pass filter approximates the large-scale landscape forms. The kernel size of the low pass filter determines the scale of features that will be visible in the LRM. A default kernel size of 25 is used.</li>
    <li>Subtract the low-pass filter result from the DEM to get the local relief.</li>
    <li>Extract the zero contour lines from the difference map.</li>
    <li>Extract the point elevations from the DEM along the zero contour lines.</li>
    <li>Create a purged DEM from the point elevations extracted in the last step. This layer represents the large-scale landscape forms that will be removed to expose the local relief in the final step. v.surf.bspline is used to interpolate the points to a raster.</li>
    <li>Subtract the purged DEM from the original DEM to get the local relief model.
</ol>

<h2>OUTPUT</h2>
<p>
r.surf.lrm creates six output files: four raster and two vector, one for each step in the LRM creation process after the DEM is created. The names consist of the user-specified output_prefix parameter and the following suffixes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>_lpf: The result of running the low pass filter on the DEM.</li>
    <li>_lpf_difference: The result of subtracting the low pass filter map from the DEM.</li>
    <li>_diff_contour: The zero contours extracted from the lpf_difference map.</li>
    <li>_points: The points containing the elevations from the input DEM along the zero contours.</li>
    <li>_purged: The raster interpolated from the _points vector.</li>
    <li>_lrm: The final local relief model.</li>
</ul>

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>
<p># Basic example using the default kernel size of 25<br>r.surf.lrm input_map=elevation output_prefix=lrm25<p>
<p># Example with a custom kernel size of 11<br>r.surf.lrm input_map=elevation output_prefix=lrm11 kernel=11</p>
